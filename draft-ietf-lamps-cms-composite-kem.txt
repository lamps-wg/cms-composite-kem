1.  Introduction

   This document acts as a companion to
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem] by providing conventions for using
   the Composite ML-KEM algorithm within the Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS).

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document is consistent with all terminology from [RFC9794].  In
   addition, the following terms are used in this document:

   *ALGORITHM*: The usage of the term "algorithm" within this document
   generally refers to any function which has a registered Object
   Identifier (OID) for use within an ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentifier.  This
   loosely, but not precisely, aligns with the definitions of
   "cryptographic algorithm" and "cryptographic scheme" given in
   [RFC9794].

   *COMBINER:* A combiner specifies how multiple shared secrets are
   combined into a single shared secret.

   *DER:* Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   *KEM:* A cryptographic key establishment mechanism, making no
   assumptions about which algorithm.

   *PKI:* Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   *SHARED SECRET KEY:* A value established between two communicating
   parties for use as cryptographic key material suitable for direct use
   by symmetric cryptographic algorithms.  This document is concerned
   with shared secrets established via public key cryptographic
   operations.

2.  Use in CMS

   Composite ML-KEM algorithms MAY be employed for one or more
   recipients in the CMS enveloped-data content type [RFC5652], the CMS
   authenticated-data content type [RFC5652], or the CMS authenticated-
   enveloped-data content type [RFC5083].  In each case, the
   KEMRecipientInfo [RFC9629] is used with the chosen Composite ML-KEM
   Algorithm to securely transfer the content-encryption key from the
   originator to the recipient.

   All recommendations for using Composite ML-KEM in CMS are fully
   aligned with the use of ML-KEM in CMS [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kyber].

2.1.  Underlying Components

   A compliant implementation MUST support the following algorithm
   combinations for the KEMRecipientInfo kdf and wrap fields when the
   corresponding Composite ML-KEM algorithm is listed in the
   KEMRecipientInfo kem field.  The KDFs listed below align with the KDF
   used internally within the KEM combiner.  An implementation MAY also
   support other key-derivation functions and other key-encryption
   algorithms within CMS KEMRecipientInfo and SHOULD use algorithms of
   equivalent strength or greater.

      Table 1: Mandatory-to-implement pairings for CMS KDF and WRAP

   Full specifications for the referenced algorithms can be found either
   further down in this section, or in Appendix D.

   Note that here we differ slightly from the internal KDF used within
   the KEM combiner in Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem]
   because [RFC9629] requires that the KDF listed in the
   KEMRecipientInfo kdf field must have an interface which accepts
   KDF(IKM, L, info), so here we need to use KMAC and cannot directly
   use SHA3.  Since we require 256-bits of (2nd) pre-image resistance,
   we use KMAC256 for the Composite ML-KEM algorithms with internally
   use SHA3-256, as aligned with Table 3 of [SP.800-57pt1r5].

2.1.1.  Use of the HKDF-based Key Derivation Function within CMS

   Unlike within the Composite KEM Combiner function, When used as a KDF
   for CMS, HKDF requires use of the HKDF-Expand step so that it can
   accept the length parameter kekLength from CMS KEMRecipientInfo as
   the HKDF parameter L.

   The HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is
   defined in [RFC5869].  The HKDF function is a composition of the
   HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand functions.

   HKDF(salt, IKM, info, L)
     = HKDF-Expand(HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM), info, L)

   HKDF(salt, IKM, info, L) takes the following parameters:

   salt:  optional salt value (a non-secret random value).  In this
      document this parameter is left at its default value, which is the
      string of HashLen zeros.

   IKM:  input keying material.  In this document this is the shared
      secret outputted from the Encaps() or Decaps() functions.  This
      corresponds to the IKM KDF input from Section 5 of [RFC9629].

   info:  optional context and application specific information.  In
      this document this corresponds to the info KDF input from
      Section 5 of [RFC9629].  This is the ASN.1 DER encoding of
      CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo.

   L:  length of output keying material in octets.  This corresponds to
      the L KDF input from Section 5 of [RFC9629], which is identified
      in the kekLength value from KEMRecipientInfo.  Implementations
      MUST confirm that this value is consistent with the key size of
      the key-encryption algorithm.

   HKDF may be used with different hash functions, including SHA-256 and
   SHA-384 [FIPS.180-4].  The object identifier id-alg-hkdf-with-sha256
   and id-alg-hkdf-with-sha384 are defined in [RFC8619], and specify the
   use of HKDF with SHA-256 and SHA-384.  The parameter field MUST be
   absent when this algorithm identifier is used to specify the KDF for
   ML-KEM in KemRecipientInfo.

2.1.2.  Use of the KMAC-based Key Derivation Function within CMS

   KMAC256-KDF is a KMAC-based KDF specified for use in CMS in
   [RFC9688].  The definition of KMAC is copied here for convenience.
   Here, KMAC# indicates the use of either KMAC128-KDF or KMAC256-KDF,
   although only KMAC256 is used in this specification.

   KMAC#(K, X, L, S) takes the following parameters:

      K: the input key-derivation key.  In this document this is the
      shared secret outputted from the Encaps() or Decaps() functions.
      This corresponds to the IKM KDF input from Section 5 of [RFC9629].

      X: the context, corresponding to the info KDF input from Section 5
      of [RFC9629].  This is the ASN.1 DER encoding of
      CMSORIforKEMOtherInfo.

      L: the output length, in bits.  This corresponds to the L KDF
      input from Section 5 of [RFC9629], which is identified in the
      kekLength value from KEMRecipientInfo.  The L KDF input and
      kekLength values are specified in octets while this L parameter is
      specified in bits.

      S: the optional customization label.  In this document this
      parameter is unused, that is it is the zero-length string "".

   The object identifier for KMAC256-KDF is id-kmac256, as defined in
   [RFC9688].

   Since the customization label to KMAC# is not used, the parameter
   field MUST be absent when id-kmac256 is used as part of an algorithm
   identifier specifying the KDF to use for Composite ML-KEM in
   KemRecipientInfo.

2.2.  RecipientInfo Conventions

   When Composite ML-KEM is employed for a recipient, the RecipientInfo
   alternative for that recipient MUST be OtherRecipientInfo using the
   KEMRecipientInfo structure as defined in [RFC9629].

   The fields of the KEMRecipientInfo MUST have the following values:

      version is the syntax version number; it MUST be 0.

      rid identifies the recipient's certificate or public key.

      kem identifies the KEM algorithm; it MUST contain one of the
      Composite ML-KEM identifiers listed in Section 6 of
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem].

      kemct is the ciphertext produced for this recipient.

      kdf identifies the key-derivation algorithm.  Note that the Key
      Derivation Function (KDF) used for CMS RecipientInfo process (to
      calculate the RecipientInfo KEK key) MAY be different than the KDF
      used within the Composite ML-KEM algorithm (to calculate the
      shared secret ss) and MAY also be different from any KDFs used
      internally within a component algorithm.

      kekLength is the size of the key-encryption key in octets.

      ukm is an optional random input to the key-derivation function.
      ML-KEM doesn't place any requirements on the ukm contents.

      wrap identifies a key-encryption algorithm used to encrypt the
      content-encryption key.

      encryptedKey is the result of encryptiong the CEK with the KEK.

2.3.  Certificate Conventions

   The conventions specified in this section augment RFC 5280 [RFC5280].

   The willingness to accept a Composite ML-KEM Algorithm MAY be
   signaled by the use of the SMIMECapabilities Attribute as specified
   in Section 2.5.2. of [RFC8551] or the SMIMECapabilities certificate
   extension as specified in [RFC4262].

   The intended application for the public key MAY be indicated in the
   key usage certificate extension as specified in Section 4.2.1.3 of
   [RFC5280].  If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate
   that conveys a Composite ML-KEM public key, then the key usage
   extension MUST contain only the following value:

   keyEncipherment

   The digitalSignature and dataEncipherment values MUST NOT be present.
   That is, a public key intended to be employed only with a Composite
   ML-KEM algorithm MUST NOT also be employed for data encryption or for
   digital signatures.  This requirement does not carry any particular
   security consideration; only the convention that KEM keys be
   identified with the keyEncipherment key usage.

2.4.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute Conventions

   Section 2.5.2 of [RFC8551] defines the SMIMECapabilities attribute to
   announce a partial list of algorithms that an S/MIME implementation
   can support.  When constructing a CMS signed-data content type
   [RFC5652], a compliant implementation MAY include the
   SMIMECapabilities attribute that announces support for the RSA-OAEP
   Algorithm.

   The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing a Composite ML-KEM
   Algorithm MUST include the appropriate object identifier as per
   Section 6 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem] in the capabilityID
   field.

Appendix A.  Implementation Considerations

A.1.  Backwards Compatibility

   TODO - say something meaningful about backwards compatibility within
   the CMS context.

A.2.  Decapsulation Requires the Public Key

   TODO - shorten this to the bit that's relevant to CMS.

   ML-KEM always requires the public key in order to perform various
   steps of the Fujisaki-Okamoto decapsulation [FIPS.203], and for this
   reason the private key encoding specified in FIPS 203 includes the
   public key.  Therefore it is not required to carry it in the
   OneAsymmetricKey.publicKey field, which remains optional, but is
   strictly speaking redundant since an ML-KEM public key can be parsed
   from an ML-KEM private key, and thus populating the
   OneAsymmetricKey.publicKey field would mean that two copies of the
   public key data are transmitted.

   With regard to the traditional algorithms, RSA or Elliptic Curve, in
   order to achieve the public-key binding property the KEM combiner
   used to form the Composite ML-KEM, the combiner requires the
   traditional public key as input to the KDF that derives the output
   shared secret.  Therefore it is required to carry the public key
   within the respective OneAsymmetricKey.publicKey as per the private
   key encoding given in Section 4.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem].  Implementers who choose to use a
   different private key encoding than the one specified in this
   document MUST consider how to provide the component public keys to
   the decapsulate routine.  While some implementations might contain
   routines to computationally derive the public key from the private
   key, it is not guaranteed that all implementations will support this;
   for this reason the interoperable composite private key format given
   in this document in Section 4.2 of [I-D.ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem]
   requires the public key of the traditional component to be included.

Appendix B.  Test Vectors

   TODO - Fix this once we have test vectors.

   The following test vectors are provided in a format similar to the
   NIST ACVP Known-Answer-Tests (KATs).

   The structure is that a global cacert is provided which is used to
   sign each KEM certificate.  Within each test case there are the
   following values:

   *  tcId the name of the algorithm.

   *  ek the encapsulation public key.

   *  x5c the X.509 certificate of the encapsulation key, signed by the
      cacert.

   *  dk the decapsulation private key.

   *  c the ciphertext.

   *  k the derived shared secret key.

   Implementers should be able to perform the following tests using the
   test vectors below:

   1.  Load the public key ek or certificate x5c and perform an
       encapsulation for it.

   2.  Load the decapsulation private key dk and the ciphertext c and
       ensure that the same shared secret key k can be derived.

   Test vectors are provided for each underlying component in isolation
   for the purposes of debugging.

   Due to the length of the test vectors, you may prefer to retrieve
   them from GitHub.  The reference implementation that generated them
   is also available:

   algorithms used in the composite constructions.
